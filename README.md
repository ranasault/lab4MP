In this lab we Fetch Data from the Pokémon TCG API

Utilize the Pokémon TCG API (https://pokemontcg. io/) to retrieve a list of Pokémon cards. The API provides JSON data with card information such as names, images, and IDs. You would generally employ fetch() (in JavaScript) or an HTTP client (like Axios) to obtain this data.

Displaying the Cards in a ListView

Implement a ListView component (according to your framework, e. g. , React, Flutter, or Android's native ListView) to show the retrieved Pokémon card images along with their titles. Each entry in the ListView would present a thumbnail image alongside the name of the Pokémon.

Handling Click Events for Enlarging Images

When a user clicks on a card image, modify the UI to present a larger version of the image. This can be achieved through a modal, a different screen, or an overlay. In React, you may utilize state (useState) to monitor the chosen image and showcase it in an enlarged format.
